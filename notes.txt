-->Golang is compiled, JAVA is not a compiled language, it is in between, it gives some intermediate binaries and expects us to have the virtual machine installed called JVM.
-->go tool can run file directly, without VM.
-->Executables are different for OS

-->WHAT IS GOLANG USED FOR?
system apps to web apps
it is already in production

-->Don't bring baggage with this language, the purpose of making this languge was entirely different

==>IS GO object orientee?
YES AND NO
-->it don't have classes, it have structs(structs are alternatives of classes)_.
-->dont have overloading.

==>lexer does a lot of work, it autocompletes our code.
->What is the reason for language designers to even start working on getting rid of tokens like semicolons? The answer is quite simple. It’s all about readability. The less artefacts code has, the easier it’s to work with. It’s important since once written piece of code will be probably read many times by different people.

Grammar uses semicolons as productions terminators. Since the goal is to free programmer from typing these semicolons, there must be a way to automatically inject them. This is what Go’s lexer is doing. Semicolon is added when line’s last token is one of:

    an identifier
    an integer, floating-point, imaginary, rune, or string literal
    one of the keywords break, continue, fallthrough, or return
    one of the operators and delimiters ++, --, ), ], or }

fmt.Println --> P is capital in this, this Println function was exported publicaly for open use

-->Variable should be known in advance.

-->everything in golang is a type.

==>TYPES:-
STRING
BOOL
INTEGER --> uint8 uint64 int8 int64 uintptr (aliases are involved too)
FLOATING --> float32 float64
COMPLEX
ARRAY
SLICES
MAPS
STRUCTS
POINTERS
